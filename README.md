# Universal Health Predictor

Universal Health Predictor is a browser-based deterministic statistical engine that performs symptom-to-disease matching using structured binary datasets.

The application ranks diseases based on selected symptoms using transparent frequency-based statistical calculations. It does not use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or built-in medical knowledge.

---

## Overview

Universal Health Predictor allows users to:

- Upload CSV or XLSX datasets
- Select symptoms or clinical indicators
- Rank diseases based on statistical frequency patterns
- Generate professional PDF reports
- Create printable multi-patient symptom checklists

All processing happens entirely in the browser. No data is transmitted, stored, or analyzed externally.

## What Technically Happens

The system operates on a structured binary matrix:

- Column 1 → Disease / Condition
- Remaining columns → Symptoms (1/0, yes/true supported)

For each selected symptom, the engine calculates:

    frequency(symptom | disease)

The match score for a disease is computed as:

    score += (symptom frequency within disease / total disease cases)

The final confidence percentage is the normalized mean of selected symptom frequencies.

Characteristics of the model:

- Deterministic
- Fully explainable
- No training phase
- No predictive AI
- No probabilistic priors
- No hidden parameters

Every output is derived strictly from user-supplied data.

## Required Dataset Structure

The dataset must follow this format:

| Disease | Fever | Cough | Fatigue | ... |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|-----|
| Flu      | 1     | 1     | 0       | ... |
| Cold     | 0     | 1     | 1       | ... |

Rules:

- First column = Disease / Condition
- Remaining columns = Binary symptoms
- Accepted positive values:
  - 1
  - yes
  - true
- Case insensitive
- Blank or 0 treated as negative

---

## Privacy & Data Handling

- All computation occurs locally in the browser.
- No dataset leaves the user’s system.
- No external API calls after initial library loading.
- No analytics or tracking.

This makes the tool suitable for internal hospital dataset exploration.

## Important Disclaimer

Universal Health Predictor is a statistical pattern-matching demonstration tool.

It does NOT:
- Provide medical diagnosis
- Replace clinical judgment
- Offer clinical decision support
- Contain built-in medical knowledge

All outputs depend strictly on user-provided datasets and statistical calculations.

The developer assumes no responsibility for decisions made using the results generated by this application.
